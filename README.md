**A collection of (some) mini scripts** :blush:
  
    
### CopyYesterday.ps1:  
Files in "Path" from yesterday will be copyed to "CopyToPath" and moved to "Backup".
A MD5-Hash for every copyed and moved File will be logged. 

### DirCheckWithTelegramNotification.py:
Just checks if a new File was created in a specific dir. If so a notification will be send with "telegram-send".
Befor using you need to setup telegram-send --> https://github.com/rahiel/telegram-send
